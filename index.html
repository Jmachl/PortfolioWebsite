  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>
    I'm an Analog and Embedded Systems Engineer based on Florida's Space Coast, working at the intersection of imagination and engineering. As founder of <a href="https://machler.xyz">Machler Labs</a>, I design expressive technologies that bridge storytelling, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. My background includes RF hardware design, microcontroller systems, and multimedia synthesis. My inventions explore the edges of playful technology, embodied cognition, and sensory feedback, often inspired by natural systems and symbolic logic.
  </p>

  <h2>Machler Labs</h2>
  <p>
    Machler Labs is my applied research and invention studio dedicated to cross-disciplinary exploration. Rooted in the belief that the future belongs to generalists who see the whole system, we prototype tools, toys, and technologies that blur the boundaries between learning and play, hardware and story, science and aesthetics. The lab's mission is to deliver emotionally intelligent, creatively disruptive experiences—especially in the hands of the next generation.

  <h2>Education</h2>
  <p>B.S.E.E. – University of Minnesota</p>

  <h2>Inventions & Projects</h2>
  <p>
    I created <strong>Toyquy™</strong>, an AR-driven platform enabling interactive narratives between toys using mobile vision and TTS. <strong>Cineplay Cards</strong> gamify cinematic storytelling through collectible trading cards, while <strong>Voice Morph AI</strong> compresses expressive TTS into deployable mobile formats. I also developed the <strong>Camcorder Shell</strong>, a 3D-printed phone adapter for cinematic play, and the <strong>Cognitive Capache</strong>, a playful alternative to CAPTCHA using mini-games and intuition challenges. My work reflects a deep love for systems thinking, media theory, and poetic interaction design.
  </p>

  <h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
  <p>
    My interests span aerospace and rocket launch systems (I’m often found photographing trails from Kennedy Space Center), optics, underwater imaging, and radio telemetry. I'm passionate about cybernetics, amateur radio, and philosophy of mind, while my hobbies include unicycling, minesweeper, cinematography, astrophotography, and tinkering with audio hardware. I enjoy sketching, exploring the nuances of etymology, web development, programming generative visuals, and designing games that leverage narrative logic. I'm equally drawn to trivia, complex visual puzzles, and the symbolic architecture of language and culture.
  </p>

  <h2>Musical Taste</h2>
  <p>
    I gravitate toward boundary-pushing sound—bands like OK Go, RUSH, The Soft Moon, Tame Impala, Pond, Pink Floyd, Aesop Rock, Depeche Mode, Tears for Fears, and Superorganism. Their layered textures and conceptual boldness mirror the way I approach invention.
  </p>

  <h2>Memberships</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a member of the Glia Society, CIVIQ Society, the ISPE (International Society for Philosophical Enquiry), and the ISI-Society. These communities fuel my curiosity and provide a sounding board for ideas that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.
